      "A good attempt to see how close one can get to Star Wars without getting sued. Better than Star Wars movies of late. Great Dark Souls spider boss fight. Everything kind of blends together after spider boss. A nice way to spend an hour before getting up, wandering around, passively experiencing explosions and plot details.",
